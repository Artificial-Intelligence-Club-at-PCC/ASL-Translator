# ASL-Translator

This open-sourced project investigates the use of deep learning and hybrid neural network models for ASL translation, taking into account sequential inputs and image processing for capturing linguistical meaning in ASL movements.

**Key Highlights**

* Convolutional Neural Network with LSTM layers for time-based realism
* OpenCV integration for real-time camera feed and translation
